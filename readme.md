# Frontend Mentor Practice

This repository contains my solutions and experiments for [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) challenges.  
The aim is to improve my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills by building pixel-perfect, responsive, and accessible UIs.

## 📂 Structure
Each challenge will be placed in its own folder, containing:
- **`index.html`** – HTML structure
- **`style.css`** – Styles for the challenge
- **`script.js`** – JavaScript functionality (if needed)
- **`design/`** – Screenshots or reference designs from the challenge


```
Example:

├── style.css
├── script.js
└── design/
```
